                <h2>My Heart's Desire</h2>
                <p>
                    In the garden of my heart, you bloom,<br>
                    A flower of rare beauty and perfume.<br>
                    Your petals soft as morning light,<br>
                    Your essence pure, a wondrous sight.<br>
                    <br>
                    With every dawn, my love grows strong,<br>
                    For you, my dear, where I belong.<br>
                    In your embrace, I find my home,<br>
                    With you, I'll never be alone.<br>
                    <br>
                    So on this day, I dare propose,<br>
                    A life together, come what may oppose.<br>
                    For you're the one my heart desires,<br>
                    My love for you, it never tires.

                <h2>Eternal Love</h2>
                <p>
                    Like stars that shine in midnight sky,<br>
                    Our love will sparkle, never die.<br>
                    Through storms and calm, through day and night,<br>
                    You are my anchor, my guiding light.<br>
                    <br>
                    With every breath, with every beat,<br>
                    My heart for you does softly speak.<br>
                    Of promises and dreams so true,<br>
                    Of endless love, just me and you.<br>
                    <br>
                    So let us walk this path as one,<br>
                    Our journey's only just begun.<br>
                    Hand in hand, heart to heart,<br>
                    Forever love, never to part.
